How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed only the sections of the file that were different to highlight the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    You can see which code works and which code doesn't

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Pro - you can control when to commit
    Con - you could forget to commit which is where having versions automatically save comes in handy

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git knows that are the files are linked in your repository while Google Docs does not care whether the files are linked or not

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    I can use the commands to see what was changed between each file or commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    I would know that I can go back to a previous copy of the files before it broke

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
