When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever you have multiple people working on the same repo. Can also use as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to edit and test your files on your computer.
